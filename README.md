> With Lora chip SX127X series as the core, connect Makepython ESP32 Lora gateway, soil moisture sensor.Soil moisture parameters are read through the Lora gateway and connected to the Wifi router to provide the browser display page.

```sequence

wifi->gate: Timed query (request)
sensor->gate: Humidity signal (broadcast)
sensor->gate: Humidity signal (broadcast)
gate->wifi: Humidity value (response)

```

- You can also try using your phone to connect to WiFi and type in the same url so you can check the soil moisture anytime, anywhere.

## 3 Arduino Explain

### 3.1 Definition

```c++
#include <SPI.h>
#include "RH_RF95.h"
```
- The Lora module is based on THE SPI protocol and Arduino communication, and USES the hardware SPI, MOSI, MISO, and SCK pins using the hardware default configuration pins.
- Rh_rf95.h, Lora chip model, compatible with SX127X series.


```C++
#define RFM95_CS 10
#define RFM95_RST 4
#define RFM95_INT 2
#define RF95_FREQ 433.0
#define RF95_PREMABLE_LENGTH 8
```
- RFM95_CS,RST,INT for Lora module segment selection, reset, interrupt.
- RF95_FREQ is the main communication frequency of Lora module at 433MHz.
- RF95_PREMABLE_LENGTH is the leading code length of Lora message.

### 3.2 Lora init

```c++
RH_RF95 rf95(RFM95_CS, RFM95_INT);
```

- Create a Lora chip object

```c++
pinMode(RFM95_RST, OUTPUT);
digitalWrite(RFM95_RST, HIGH);
delay(10);
digitalWrite(RFM95_RST, LOW);
delay(10);
digitalWrite(RFM95_RST, HIGH);
delay(10);
```

- Restart the Lora module

```c++
while (!rf95.init())
{
  Serial.println("LoRa radio init failed");
  while (1)
    ;
}
Serial.println("LoRa radio init OK!");
```

- Initialize the Lora module object

```c++
  if (!rf95.setFrequency(RF95_FREQ))
  {
    Serial.println("setFrequency failed");
    while (1)
      ;
  }
  Serial.print("Set Freq to: ");
  Serial.println(RF95_FREQ);
```

- Set the Lora communication frequency

```c++
rf95.setTxPower(23, false);
rf95.setPreambleLength(RF95_PREMABLE_LENGTH);

//rf95.printRegisters();
```

- setTxPower:  Set transmitting power
- setPreambleLength:  Sets the length of the leading code
- printRegisters:  Prints all register contents



### 3.3 Soil moisture detection module


```c++
  sensorValue = analogRead(SENSOR_PIN);
  String temp = String(sensorValue);
  Serial.println(sensorValue);
  String message = "SOIL" + temp;
  Serial.println(message);
```

- Splice the soil sensor values into a Message string.

```c++
uint8_t radioPacket[message.length() + 1];
message.toCharArray(radioPacket, message.length() + 1);
radioPacket[message.length() + 1] = '\0';
Serial.println("Sending...");
delay(10);
rf95.send((uint8_t *)radioPacket, message.length() + 1);
```

- Converts a string to a byte stream
- Rf95.send (Uint8_t *) sends the byte stream through the Lora protocol.


## 4 Python Explain

### 4.1 controller.py


- The Controller class is the parent class that abstracts the basic pin content of the Lora module.
- Add_transceiver () adds an SX127X chip object as the send chip, because the MakePython Lora can carry two SX127X chips.
- The remaining functions are some of the early test functions, or hardware pin preparation functions, of no concern to this experiment.

### 4.2 controller_esp.py

- Machine module of MicroPyton is referenced to prepare SPI and GPIO initialization.
- The Controller_esp.Controller class inherits from controller.Controller.
- The model and SPI pins of the hardware for ESP were determined.
- The rest of the overloaded member functions are initialized by hardware pins such as SPI.

### 4.3  controller_esp_lora_oled.py

- controller_esp_lora_oled.Controller class inherits from the  controller_esp.Controller。
- The Controller_ESP_lora_OLd.Controller class inherits from the Controller_esp.Controller.

### 4.4 ssd1306.py

- Ssd1306 led screen driver.

### 4.5 display_ssd1306_i2c.py

- Text display function.
- Image display function.

### 4.6 sx127x.py

- Lora module driver function.
- Includes basic Lora module Settings such as frequency, lead code, calibration, spread spectrum factor, etc.

### 4.7 config_lora.py

- To accommodate some configuration code for multiple platforms.

### 4.8 lora_node.py

- Lora Gateway object.

# INFO

## 1 Lora parameter description

### 1.1 Default parameters

|attribute|value|
| ---- | ---- |
|frequency|433MHz|
|tx_power_level| 23 |
|signal_bandwidth | 125KHz |
|spreading_factor | 7|
|coding_rate|8|
|preamble_length|8|
|implicitHeader|True|
|sync_word| 0x12|
|enable_CRC| True|

### 1.2 SpreadingFactor

LoRaTM spread spectrum modulation USES multiple information chips to represent each bit of payload information.The speed at which spread spectrum information is transmitted
The degree is called the symbol rate (Rs), and the ratio between the chip rate and the nominal symbol rate is the spread spectrum factor, which represents each
The number of symbols sent by bits of information.The value range of spread spectrum factor in LoRaTM modem is shown in the table below.

|RegModulationCfg|Chips / symbol|
| -- | -- |
| 6 | 64 |
| 7 | 128 |
| 8 | 256 |
| 9 | 512 |
| 10 | 1024 |
| 11 | 2048 |
| 12 | 4096 |

### 1.3 Coding Rate

In order to improve the robustness of link, LoRaTM modem adopts cyclic error correction code for forward error detection and correction
Fault.After using such error-correcting coding, there is a transfer overhead.The data overhead per transfer is shown in the table below.




| CodingRate(RegTxCfg1) | Cyclic Coding | Rate Overhead Ratio |
| ------ | ---------- | -------- |
| 1      | 4/5        | 1.25     |
| 2      | 4/6        | 1.5      |
| 3      | 4/7        | 1.75     |
| 4      | 4/8        | 2        |

### 1.4 Signal Bandwidth
The unit is **kHz** and the common value is **125kHz**

### 1.5 Preamble

The Preamble code is used to keep the receiver in sync with the input data stream.By default, the packet contains 12 symbol lengths before
Guide yards.The leading length is a variable that can be set programmatically, so the length of the leading code can be extended.

### 1.6 Payload

The packet payload is a field of variable length, while the actual length and error correction encoding rate (CR) are in explicit mode
The header is specified or determined by the Settings in registers in implicit mode.



## 2 Q&A

### 2.1 Arduino Lora differs from Python Lora byte stream

Byte streams emitted by ArduinoLora:

```c++
b'\xff\xff\x00\x00{"msg":"test","code":0,"sys":{"name":"xbw","num":"001","type":0},"data":{"index":160,"ADC":123}}\x00'
```

PythonLora emits a byte stream:

```c++
b'{"msg":"test","code":0,"sys":{"name":"xbw","num":"001","type":0},"data":{"index":160,"ADC":123}}'
```

Because the Arduino and Python use different Lora libraries, the messages sent are different.The Arduino message has an extra 4 bytes in the front and one byte in the tail, so it cannot be decoded directly by Python decod() function, so it needs to be truncated in advance.It must also be added manually when it is sent to the Arduino side, otherwise the Arduino side cannot receive it normally.
